  Project topic was finalised and project abstract was completed succesfully and submitted.
  
August 12, 2018:
  Rough idea about the project was discussed, problem was defined, basic implementation details was 
  identified (Fast Gradient Sign Method). A level 0 presentation was prepared on these things.
  
August 13, 2018:
  Level 0 presentation conducted and succesfully presented.
  
September 14, 2018:
  Downloaded the dataset - MNIST (70,000 images) - 28x28 pixel images split into training and test set.
  
September 30, 2018:
  Papers related to the project topic was downloaded and started reading literatures.
  "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples",
  "Ensemble adversarial training: attacks and defenses"
  
October 5, 2018:
    Level 1 presentation was prepared based on literature review and presented successfully.
    
November 2, 2018:
  Level-2 presentation is prepared - The Requirement Specification Document. It lists the basic design of the
  model, the constraints and algorithm.

November 9, 2018:
	The team decided to transfer the project diary contents to Github. Discussed the requirements in detail as per the instructions from the guides and started modifying the Level 2 presentation. Two UML diagrams were prepared - one being an activity diagram and the other being the model diagram.

November 16, 2018:
	Level 2 presentation was presented. In addition to the functional and process requirements, we added the physical environment (model training in the cloud)  and the details of deployment of our project. The user will be given a web application to interact with, which will provide the user with a random captcha generated real time. The user will be given a text box to give the response to the displayed captcha. Quality constraints were added as per the instructions from our guide. Currently working on the detailed design of our project.
