We plan to finish the Captcha Generator, basically a Python program, by the end of this week. We are also working on modifying the dataset.
We are currently reading a paper, “CAPTCHA Recognition with Active Deep Learning” - Fabian Stark, Caner Hazrbas, Rudolph Triebel and Daniel Cremers, for reference relating to building the CNN model.

February 8 :

We found a script that can be used to generate captchas. 
It can be used to generate captchas containing lowercase and uppercase alphabets and digits.
It also allows us to generate captchas of different length. For our project, we have decided to restrict the captcha length to 6 lowercase characters. We have generated 1,80,000 captchas.
